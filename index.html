<h1>What are butterflies?</h1>

<h2>The history of the butterflies</h2>

<p> The world's continents were much closer when butterflies originated 100 million years ago. Butterflies originated
     in North/Central America before dispersing into other parts of the globe in a complicated crosshatch of flyways
      that ultimately led to their current distributions. </p>

<h2>The stages</h2>

<p> Metamorphosis is a series of major changes in an animal's body form as it moves through its life cycle. Butterflies 
    and moths undergo a complete metamorphosis, which means there are four separate stages in the life 
    cycle (egg, larva, pupa, and adult). </p>
